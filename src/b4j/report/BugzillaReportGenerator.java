/**
 * Interface for a report generator.
 * Generates a report from bug data and writes its results to some
 * place. The place is defined by the implementation of this class.
 * <p>
 * A report instance is usually created first, then {@link #init(Configuration)}
 * will be called to give the object a chance to configure itself from
 * some configuration object (usually XML based).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Then, {@link #prepareReport()} will be called for each separate report this 
 * object has to create.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Next, the object will receive each bug to take into account. A report
 * shall collect all necessary information from the bug and forget about the
 * bug itself immediately as potentially thousands of bugs might be queued up.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Finally, {@link #closeReport()} will be called. This is the place where
 * your implementation should persist its collected data. Some abstract
 * classes are provided to ease the writing of new reports.
 * </p>
