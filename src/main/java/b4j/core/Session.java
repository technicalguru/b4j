/**
 * Represents a Bugzilla session. All interactions are performed through implementations
 * of this interface. Bugzilla sessions could be based on HTTP or MYSQL protocols or any
 * other mean of connection. This is transparent to the application using such a session.
 * <p>
 * Bugzilla latest version 3 announced an XML-RPC Webservice interface. However, all
 * functions seems to be marked unstable and/or experimental. So no session implementation
 * for that protocol will be delivered yet. The author regards that service as highly welcome
 * as it will support the B4J features in best way.
 * <p>
 * This interface can be extended in later versions to support GUI-styled interfaces. Future
 * additions might include addBug(), editBug(), listAccounts().
 * </p>
